Using the technique described in class implement a recursive
	descent parser that recognizes strings in this language.  Input
	should be from a file called input.txt and output should be to the
	console.  An example session might look like this (these strings
	are not necessarily in the language):
  
 Consider the following BNF grammar:

E -> P O P | P
O -> + | - | * | / | **
P -> I | L | UI | UL | (E)
U -> + | - | !
I -> C | CI
C -> a | b | ... | y | z
L -> D | DL
D -> 0 | 1 | ... | 8 | 9
